                As you will see in the next three charts, the analysis confirms the overall growth rate of 95% 
                <br>and the emergence of new markets in the e-commerce and retailer distribution channels, 
                <br>with a collective 43% of 2021 sales.  (Please note:  our team was asked to mask data for 
                <br>retailers and e-commerce.  They are generically presented as 1 and 2).  The data shows the following:

                        Evidence of exceptionally strong growth over the two years in all channels except wholesale, which grew only 13%.  Based on discussions with the Vitamin Ventures team, wholesalers are believed to be an important aspect of their brand awareness and word of mouth marketing. We recommend they still build these relationships, but the growth is not there based on the data.  It has stayed stagnant and unsteady.

                    <li>
                        While there is overall growth, some trend instability is present with some dips and spikes in the data especially for retailer and website sales.  These dips coincide with the company’s known supply chain issues.  This issue will be further addressed in the product analysis.

        <br>
        <h3 >
            Vitamin Ventures offers 75 different products (see chart - Number of Products by Sales Channel).  All 75 are offered through their website and only a select few are offered through the other channels.  The trend line chart of the top products (Top Products Sales Growth 2020 and 2021) more explicitly demonstrates the supply chain issues with items being out of stock which makes it hard to tell if there is any seasonality to the data.  After discussing this data with the board, Vitamin Ventures confirms that sometimes they will have to turn away orders based on supply chain issues.

<br>
<br>            Based on our data (see chart Total Skus Breakdown by Channels), the top two products, sku 6666 Thyroid Complex and 3333 Fruits and Greens 30 capsules, roughly 33% of all sales were purchased through their e-commerce vendor, Amazon.  Further analysis revealed the top 15 products account for 80% of Vitamin Ventures’ total sales while the other 50 products only produce 20%.
Even if they are worried about taking away sales from their own website, they need to keep in mind that the volume of the sales that Amazon and Target can provide them, will make up for the marginal decrease in profit that the third-party vendor costs
<br>
<br>
For future, Vitamin Ventures should release three or four more products to an e-commerce channel and to a big box retailer.  Additionally, they should not invest as much time and effort into their wholesalers.
