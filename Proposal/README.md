# Project Vitamin Ventures

Proposal Requirements – Orange Group
1.	Morgan created the repo for our project
2.	http://github.com/HotMochaNoWhip/Vitamin_Ventures

**Topic:**
Our goal is to analyze real historical vitamin sales data obtained from an actual company (to remain anonymous) to project future sales potential – overall, by product, and by vendor. We will analyze sales growth using actual sales for calendar year 2020 and 2021. Through this analysis we will determine how sales growth should be represented best i.e., by sales revenue, number of accounts, units sold, or other. We will determine if an additional vendor should be added based on past vendor performance. We will determine what the average customer spends and look for patterns. We may use some type of regression analysis to project future sales. We will model the performance and projections using Matplotlib and Tableau and display data charts where appropriate. 

**Tech Stack:**
* Excel (Data cleaning and masking per company guidelines and disclosure agreements - all product identities are masked/encoded) 
* Postgres (Data Exploration and Table creation for new visualizaitons)
* Plotly (integrated web visualizations)
* Javascript / HTML (web format through repo.io)

**Deliverable(s):**
* Upon review with teacher assistants this list can be expanded. 
* Develop CSV files to house data which will then be imported to Postgres for exploration. 
* Determine if we have all of the data we need to perform meaningful analysis 
* Run queries in SQL and Export tables for visalization:
    * Sales trends from 2020 and 2021
    * Highest/lowest times for sales
    * Vendor performance
    * Product category performance
    * Any additional exploratory finds
* Display data in meaningful ways:
    * Tablular data tables
    * Trend line plots
    * Pie charts
    * Product bar charts
    * Customer reports
* Analysis documentation for each trend displayed in web alongside interactive visualizations


**Timeline**

Week of 1/3:
- Define project Topic, Tech stack, and Deliverables
- Determine source of data
- Clean Data for use in Postgres

Week of 1/10:
- Import data into Postgres database
- Explore data in Postgres with SQL Queries
- Determine measurements for Plotly interactive graphs/tables
- Create new tables for easy analysis and visalizations and export from Postgres

Week of 1/17:
- Create shell for Javascript/HTML to house data
- Create working Plotly visualizations
- Create Python file for Javascript integration

Week of 1/24:
- Debug any current issues
- Integrate code with main branch to test web visualization
- If extra time permits, potentally dive into statsmodels python package and see if we can implement any predictive sales models for next year
- Push final code changes

Week of 1/31:
- Clean up any quality improvements
- Submit for grading
